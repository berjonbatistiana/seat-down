# HypeType

## Description

HypeType is a typing challenge project created in React.js. As of late, the job sector of not only web development, but computer based jobs has skyrocketed in the United States and world wide. This creates a critical need for being able to type accurately and quickly in order to be efficient at work. Many other typing games on the internet can leave you lost in a mess of complex gameplay, confusing user interfaces or a slur of advertisements. HypeType provides the user with a clean, easy to understand user experience, offering multiple options for their typing challenge. They can follow along with live updates on their words per minute and accuracy. They can also view their personal dashboard to view data about the history of their performances during challenges.
