# Workspace

## Description

Workspace is an employee management system. With COVID-19 causing massive disruption to the way we work, employers need to have an easy way to manage employee seating and scheduling. Workspace allows employers to enable their employees the ability to be able to reserve a seat that they need on a certain day. Many employees don't work on site every day, and hot desking is becoming much more popular. This app caters to flexible desk scheduling for employers who want to downsize their workspace or optimize what they have. Read more below to find out more.
